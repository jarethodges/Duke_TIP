WD annotation

#The first step is to establish the working drive where the files are located#

#Note: in windows, '\' needs to be double slash '\\' See the example below#

#setwd returns the current directory before the change
It will give an error if it does not succeed 
(including if it is not implemented)#

#The code setwd(dir) is used to set the working directory to your desired 
filepath. In this case, the file path is located at in the R_folder in the 
Research drive.#

	setwd ("S:\\TIP\\Research\\Surveys and Data\\R_folder")
